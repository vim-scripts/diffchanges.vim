Show changes made to current buffer since the last save. This plugin is based from an example in the Hacking Vim book. The differences are that this functionality is in the form of a plugin, is a bit more robust, and can be toggled.

COMMANDS
DiffChangesDiffToggle -- toggles the side-by-side diff view
DiffChangesPatchToggle -- toggles the patch view

MAPPINGS (<leader> is set to '\&#039, by default)
<leader>dcd -- DiffChangesDiffToggle
<leader>dcp -- DiffChangesPatchToggle

You can override the default mappings by creating mappings like this:

nmap <F6> <Plug>DiffChangesDiffToggle
nmap <F7> <Plug>DiffChangesPatchToggle

OPTIONS
g:diffchanges_patch_cmd -- The command that's used to generate the patch (default: 'diff -u').
